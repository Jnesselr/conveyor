Debian/Ubuntu installation paths
================================

We're playing a little fast and loose with the Linux filesystem hierarchy, but to be blunt it's not terribly well-defined anyway.

## Configuration files

Configuration files are stored in /etc. Currently there is one configuration file for conveyor, conveyor.conf.
* /etc/conveyor.conf
** Copied by scons, installed by conveyor.install

## Static libraries

The static library is stored in /usr/lib.
* /usr/lib/libconveyor.a
** Built by scons, installed by conveyor.install

## Header files

The header files are stored in /usr/include.
* /usr/include/conveyor.h
** Copied by scons, installed by conveyor.install

## Conveyor python modules

The Conveyor python module is stored in /usr/share/conveyor/lib.
* /usr/share/conveyor/lib/conveyor/
** Copied by scons, installed by conveyor.install

An argument could be made that this belongs in /usr/lib/conveyor; this was avoided to ensure that we didn't touch too many bits of the filesystem.

## Conveyor virtualenv

The virtualenv environment is generated in /usr/share/conveyor.
* /usr/share/conveyor/virtualenv
** Generated by conveyor.postinst

## Wrapper

The binary wrapper, conveyor, is installed in /usr/bin.
* /usr/bin/conveyor
