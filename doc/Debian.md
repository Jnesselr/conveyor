Debian/Ubuntu packaging notes
======================

Users and permissions
---------------------

We are creating a "conveyor" user to run the conveyor script as.

Debian/Ubuntu installation paths
--------------------------------

We're playing a little fast and loose with the Linux filesystem hierarchy, but to be blunt it's not terribly well-defined anyway.

## Configuration files

Configuration files are stored in /etc. Currently there is one configuration file for conveyor, conveyor.conf.
* /etc/conveyor.conf
** Copied by scons, installed by conveyor.install

## Static libraries

The static library is stored in /usr/lib.
* /usr/lib/libconveyor.a
** Built by scons, installed by conveyor.install

## Header files

The header files are stored in /usr/include.
* /usr/include/conveyor.h
** Copied by scons, installed by conveyor.install

## Conveyor python modules

The Conveyor python module is stored in /usr/share/conveyor/lib.
* /usr/share/conveyor/lib/conveyor/
** Copied by scons, installed by conveyor.install

An argument could be made that this belongs in /usr/lib/conveyor; this was avoided to ensure that we didn't touch too many bits of the filesystem.

## Conveyor virtualenv

The virtualenv environment is generated in /usr/share/conveyor.
* /usr/share/conveyor/virtualenv
** Generated by conveyor.postinst

## Wrapper

The binary wrapper, conveyor, is installed in /usr/bin.
* /usr/bin/conveyor
** //TODO// - does not exist

## Log files

//TODO//

## Init.d files

//TODO//
This file begins like as debian/conveyor.init
* /etc/init.d/conveyor
This file is installed by dh_installinit.

## Lock files

Lock files are created in the /var/run/conveyor directory by conveyor itself. This directory is owned by the conveyor user.
* /var/run/conveyor
** Created by postinst
